
R: Number of rows in the matrix.
C: Number of columns in the matrix.

------>The idea is to construct a matrix S where S[i][j] represents the size of the largest square ending at cell (i, j) and having all 1s.

printMaxSubSquare:

------>Takes a boolean matrix M as input.
------>Constructs a new matrix S where each entry S[i][j] represents the size of the largest square ending at cell (i, j) and having all 1s.
------>Finds the maximum entry in S to determine the size of the largest square and the corresponding indexes (max_i, max_j) where the square ends.
------>Prints the size of the maximum square submatrix (2 times the size) and the submatrix itself.


main:

------>Defines a boolean matrix M representing a binary matrix.
------>Calls the printMaxSubSquare function to find and print the maximum square submatrix
